It provides an architecture to manage resources dynamically at runtime. JMX is used mostly in enterprise applications to make the system configurable or to get the state of application at any point of time.

We use JMX Connectors to connect to MBean server and to manage the registered resources. For example, JDK comes with JConsole through which you can connect to any local or remote MBean server.
